# Logos for open source 

Hello! I am Nadya. I live in Berlin, study interface design in [FHP](https://www.fh-potsdam.de) and work as an intern at [LucasFonts](https://www.lucasfonts.com/home/). I often use open source software at the university and at work, therefore I want to contribute back with something that I can do best. My goal is to help open source projects gain popularity through improved recognition. To accomplish this goal, I offer free logos for open source projects.

### How to participate:

1. Make sure that your project has [a good README](https://opensource.com/open-organization/17/10/readme-maturity-model)
2. [Create an issue](https://github.com/kuzminadya/l4os/issues/new) with a link to your project

Depending on my availability, I will choose projects with the best READMEs and work on pull requests, [similar to this one](https://github.com/redux-loop/redux-loop/pull/73), containing a logo and the [cc0-1.0 license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc0-1.0/). It is then up to you to decide whether to merge it!
